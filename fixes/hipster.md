# Fixing Hipster Ipsem

Now you know how to submit fixes to a remote repository, and how to report bugs clearly and concisely, it's time to "fix" the FOSS4GUK HipsterIpsem document.

Each of you will have received a card telling you what problem to fix.

Depending on the nature of the problem, you will either need to report an issue in the repository, or you will fix the problem in your local copy of the repository and submit a pull request to get it fixed.

## The Rules

 * You must provide clear and concise bug reports or pull requests
 * I reserve the right to reject a request or close an issue if I don't think you've been clear enough
 * You must only fix or report the problem you've been assigned
