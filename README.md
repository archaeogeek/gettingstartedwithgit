# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

**See online version at [archaeogeek.github.io/gettingstartedwithgit](http://archaeogeek.github.io/gettingstartedwithgit/)**

This workshop is inspired by the "Don't be afraid to commit" workshops run at various PyCon events, and documented at [readthedocs](http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) but with a focus on getting you going with Git and GitHub (*), and submitting minor fixes to existing projects. We'll also look briefly at your methods for recovering from diaster.

\* Other repositories do exist

# The purpose of the workshop

We'll hopefully get you in a position where you're familiar with the basic concepts involved with Command-line Git, GitHub and submitting minor pull requests.

# What we're covering

* Hands on- how to set up and use Git and GitHub
* Hands on- how to submit brief documentation fixes to projects on GitHub
* Hands on- how to submit a pull request to a project hosted on GitHub
* Extras- how to recover from disaster
