# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

**See online version at [archaeogeek.github.io/gettingstartedwithgit](http://archaeogeek.github.io/gettingstartedwithgit/)**

This workshop is inspired by the "Don't be afraid to commit" workshops run at various PyCon events, and documented at [readthedocs](http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) but with a focus on getting you going with Git and GitHub (*), and submitting minor fixes to existing projects. We'll also look at other repositories such as GitLab, and at integration with packages such as ReadTheDocs, which you might come across when getting into open source.

\* Other repositories exist

# The purpose of the workshop

We'll hopefully get you in a position where you're familiar with the basic concepts involved with Command-line Git, GitHub and submitting minor pull requests.

# What we're covering

* Hands on- how to set up and use Git and GitHub
* Hands on- how to submit brief documentation fixes to projects on GitHub
* Hands on- how to submit a pull request to a project hosted on GitHub
* Intro- what is GitLab and how is it different to GitHub?
* Intro- what is ReadTheDocs and how do I contribute documentation fixes to it?

# What we're not covering

* GUIs for Git/GitHub- too many different variants exist to easily teach in one class, and besides a bit of CLI-fu is a good thing
* Specific Open Source Projects
