# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

**See online version at [archaeogeek.github.io/gettingstartedwithgit](http://archaeogeek.github.io/gettingstartedwithgit/)**

This workshop is inspired by the "Don't be afraid to commit" workshops run at various PyCon events, and documented at [readthedocs](http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) but with a focus on getting you going with Git and GitHub, and submitting fixes (or pull requests). We'll also look at other repositories such as GitLab, and at integration with packages such as ReadTheDocs, which you might come across when getting into open source.
