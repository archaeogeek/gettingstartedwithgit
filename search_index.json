We'll also look at other repositories such as GitLab, and at integration with packages such as ReadTheDocs, which you might come across when getting into open source.\n\nOther repositories exist\n\nThe purpose of the workshop\nWe'll hopefully get you in a position where you're familiar with the basic ideas of using Command-line Git, GitHub and submitting minor pull requests.\nWhat we're covering\n\nHands on- how to set up and use Git and GitHub\nHands on- how to submit brief documentation fixes to projects on GitHub\nHands on- how to submit a pull request to a project hosted on GitHub\nIntro- what is GitLab and how is it different to GitHub?\nIntro- what is ReadTheDocs and how do I contribute documentation fixes to it?\n\nWhat we're not covering\n\nGUIs for Git/GitHub\n\n"},"intro/":{"url":"intro/","title":"Prerequisites","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nPrequisites\nKnowledge\nYou need to know how to access the terminal or command prompt on your computer.

See git-all for details. \nWindows\nThere are two good options for installing Git on windows:\nGit for Windows\nThis project focuses on providing the full Git featureset for windows users in a lightweight interface. You can find it at git-for-windows.\nGitHub Desktop\nThis is more focused on integration with GitHub, and comes with a flashy user interface as well as a solid set of tools. You can find it at GitHub Desktop. In my experience this is slower and more resource-heavy than Git for Windows.\nNote that both installers above include a graphical user interface but we're going to concentrate on using the command-line version as it's quicker, in many ways easier, and certainly uses less system resources.\nMac OSX\nThere are several ways of installing Git on a Mac:\nVia Xcode Command Line Tools\nYou may already have this installed. Try opening Terminal and typing:\ngit\nIf you haven't got it installed already then it will prompt you to install it.\nVia the Git website\nThis version will provide you with the most recent maintained (eg stable) build of git and will likely be more up to date than that provided as part of Xcode.

So firstly, let's talk about what \"version control\" means, and specifically what git-style version control means.\nA brief guide to version control\nVersion Control Systems (VCS) are a way of recording changes to a file or files over time, with the ability to go back to a specific version of a file, or all the files in a project, at a later date. Changes to files, or patches, are stored within the project, or repository, and a file can be restored to a specific point in time by adding up the relevant patches.\nCentralised VCS such as Subversion allow multiple people to work on a repository simultaneously. They store the repository and all its changes on a single server and each end-user or client simply downloads or checkes out the latest version or snapshot to use on their local computer. This means that the central server is a single point of failure. Losing that means losing the entire history of the project. The latest snapshot is still available on the client computers, but the record of all the changes has been lost.\nModern Distributed VCS, such as Git or Mercurial, get around this single point of failure by insisting that each end-user or client mirrors the entire repository onto their local computer. Each mirror, or clone, of the central repository can be used to restore the central one in the event of a failure and each client can have their own workflow for interacting with the central repository.\nWhy Git\nGit is not the only Distributed VCS tool out there, but it has become the most popular. It was always built with speed in mind, and the ability to efficiently handle large projects.\nIt is different to Subversion and other Centralised VCS because rather than storing each change as a patch to a specific file, it treats each change as a snapshot of the whole repository file structure. If a file in the structure hasn't changed, then Git simply stores a link back to the previous identical file.\nOld-School Centralised VCS:\n\nNew-School Distributed VCS like Git:\n\nFinally, nearly every Git operation is local, making it ideal for long train journeys!\n"},"git/gitsetup.html":{"url":"git/gitsetup.html","title":"Getting set up","keywords":"","body":"First time setup steps\nSince Git is designed to record changes to a global repository, it needs to be able to identify you and provide a means of contact. When you first start working with Git, you need to do a couple of initial setup steps to configure this information.\nThese steps are global, in that they will apply for all repositories you set up on your current local machine.\nThis information will be visible in all repositories you make public so don't use details you'd rather keep private\nThese settings can be overridden on a per-repository basis but we won't cover that here\nAt your git terminal type:\ngit config --global user.name \"Your name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your.email@yourmailserver.com\"\nThe command:\ngit config --list\nwill show you the existing Git config settings.\nThere are many additional settings that can be configured using git-config. For a comprehensive listing see git-config.\nConfiguring Git to use the text editor of your choice\nBy default Git will use your operating system's default editor. On Windows that's probably NotePad, on Mac it's probably Text Edit. On Linux- vi, or nano. The following command is used to set the default text editor for Git:\ngit config --global core.editor \"/path/to/your/editorexecutable\"\nThe exact format of the path to use here will be dependent on your operating system. This link shows you how to set up the core editor config for a number of example packages in Windows, Mac and Linux.\n"},"git/repository.html":{"url":"git/repository.html","title":"Your first repository","keywords":"","body":"Creating your first local repository\nFolders and files are not version-controlled until we explicitly ask them to be. This process is called initialising a repository.\nFirstly we need to create a folder to hold our files. We do this at the git command prompt using the following syntax:\nmkdir -p gitrepositories/foss4gukdontbeafraid\nThis creates a folder called gitrepositories and a sub-folder called foss4gukdontbeafraid in one step. \nWhere is this?\nIf you don't specify a location for this folder, then it will use a default location as follows:\n\nLinux: /home/yourname\nWindows using Git Bash: C:\\Users\\yourname\nWindows using GitHub Desktop: C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\GitHub\nMac using Git from XCode: /Users/yourname\nMac using GitHub Desktop: \n\nNow change directory to foss4gukdontbeafraid:\ncd gitrepositories/foss4gukdontbeafraid\nInitialise it as a repository:\ngit init\nThis might not appear to do anything but it creates a hidden folder called .git inside foss4gukdontbeafraid that contains the information Git needs to track your repository.\nOn windows, change your folder preferences to \"always view hidden folders\" so you can see this folder\nThat's all we can do until we start adding some files and making changes to them, so let's make a file:\ntouch blah.txt\nThis creates a blank text file called \"blah.txt\" in the folder.\nAt this point, we have enough in place to start committing to our repository.\n"},"git/stages.html":{"url":"git/stages.html","title":"The three stages of Git","keywords":"","body":"The three stages of Git\nFiles in a repository go through three stages before being under version control with git:\n\nUntracked: the file exists, but is not part of git's version control\nStaged: the file has been added to git's version control but changes have not been committed\nCommitted: the change has been committed\n\nGit-status is used to understand what stage the files in a repository are at.\ngit status\nThe output of this command not only tells you the stage of the files in your repository but also gives you some handy tips on what to do next.\n\nStage\nSo our next stage is to add our files to the staging area:\ngit add blah.txt\nIf we re-run the git status command at this point the output has changed:\n\nCommit\nThe final stage is to commit the change we have made. We do this by recording a short message that explains what we did and why. This human-readable explanation will go alongside Git's own record of the change and the file structure snapshot at that point.\ngit commit\nThis pops open your default text editor (depending on what you configured in your setup stage) and asks for a commit message. The screenshot below shows an example using the nano editor on linux:\n\nOnce your commit message has been saved and you are back at your git command prompt, you will see a summary of the changes git has made. Running git status again will tell you that your \"working directory is clean\", in other words you have no untracked files or uncommitted changes:\n\nNote that we can shorten these steps slightly using the -m flag to the git commit statement. Staging and committing can therefore be done in one go using the following syntax:\ngit commit -m\"First commit of currently blank text file\"\nAlso, running git log will give you a nicely formatted record of your changes:\ngit log\n\nNote that long string of characters and numbers. That's an unique ID, or SHA, for that particular commit. You might sometimes need to refer to this!\nLet's make a change to the file so we can try out some other commands...\nIn your text editor of choice, add a line to blah.txt that says what your name is, and save the file.\nWe can view the difference between that version of the file and the committed one (eg the changes) using the following command:\ngit diff\nThis should give output similar to the following:\n\nAgain we need to add this file to the staging area and then commit it's changes. Since the file is already in the repository, we can use another shortcut to add it and commit it in one go:\ngit commit -am\"Added name to blah.txt\"\nRunning git diff again should show no changes, as the file and repository are up to date.\nOne useful command in this section is the \"--amend\" flag for git commit, which allows you to amend the previous commit, for example to fix a spelling mistake.\ngit commit --amend\nIgnoring files\nThere are many scenarios where you might end up with files in your repository that you don't want to place under source control. These might be backup files that text editors create, compiled python files (.pyc) or even files with sensitive information in, such as passwords. You can place these in a file called .gitignore (which will be hidden by default).\nRemoving and renaming files\nGit uses the unix mv (move or rename) and rm (remove) commands, but also deals with the tasks of staging and unstaging the files too.\nIt's important to note that you need to use a different version of the git rm (or even just rm) command depending on what you want to do\n\nrm file # removes a file that hasn't been added to the repository yet- this will delete the file from your file system\ngit rm file # removes the file from the repository and deletes it from your file system\ngit rm --cached file # removes the file from the repository but doesn't delete it from your file system\n\n"},"git/commandsummary.html":{"url":"git/commandsummary.html","title":"Git command summary","keywords":"","body":"Git Command Summary\n\ngit init initialise a repository\ngit add  add a file to the staging area\ngit commit commit changes to the repository\n-a automatically stage existing files\n-m add commit message directly\n\n\n git log show changes in commits\ngit diff compare repository with last commit\ngit mv rename files in filesystem and repository\ngit rm remove files in filesystem and repository\n--cached remove files from repository but not filesystem\n\n\ngit clone clone a remote repository\ngit checkout  checkout a new branch\ngit checkout -b   create and checkout a new branch\n\n\ngit push push your committed changes to the remote repository\n-u origin  set the remote repository branch you want to commit to\n\n\ngit pull download changes from remote repository\n\n"},"refs/":{"url":"refs/","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"References\n\nCommand Line Basics\nDJango Girls Intro to the Command Line\nLearn enough git to be dangerous (ebook)\nGitHub Pull Request Tutorial\n\n"}}}
